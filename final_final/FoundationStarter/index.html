<!--intro to rest of the story-->
<p>In just a few short years the sport of College Football is almost unrecognizable. While there are many factors to this such as the transfer portal and re-alignment, the main force of change is NIL.</p>

<p>Each of the Power 4 schools will be sharing $20.5 million of revenue with the players on each of the sports teams. But, how they divy up the pie of that $20.5 millions is up to each school. <a href="https://nil-ncaa.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com/////"target="_blank"> On average Power 4 schools </a> will share 75% of their revenue with football players. Another 15% will go to basketball players, and the other 10% will go to the other sports at each school. So this means, on average $15,375,000 goes to the football team, $3,075,000 to the basketball team, and $2,050,000 to all of the other sports. However, per player, football on average would not be the most due to the amount of players on the team. There are 105 players on each Power 4 football team, there are 15 players on a basketball team, and all other sports have an average of 456 scholarship athletes. So on average a Power 4 football player is paid $146,428, the average basketball player $205,000, and the average player in all other sports is $4,495. The stark difference from football and basketball to all of the other sports is because the television contracts are built around those two sports. Those two sports are known as "revenue" generating sports, while none of the others are. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/ncaa-settlement-forcing-cuts-to-college-teams-in-olympic-sports/////"target="_blank">This has actually forced universities around the nation to cut Olympic sports programs that do not make money. </a></p>

<p>The next logical question is; where is the money coming from? It is from TV. College sports, and specifically, College Football has been big business for a very long time. In the 21st century, the sport has become a multi-billion dollar business. Each conference signs TV contracts with broadcast partners to broadcast the games of the conference. <a href="https://businessofcollegesports.com/current-college-sports-television-contracts//////"target="_blank">The current Power 4 conferences hold multi-billion dollar deals with several different broadcast partners. </a> Each team does make some money from tickets sold, concessions, and merch. The majority of the revenue is broken down in the television contracts though. Let's look at the Big Ten contract for example. The $8.05 billion dollar deal is for a seven year period. That means the deal ends in the 2029-2030 season. There are four television partners in the deal; FOX, CBS, NBC, and B1G Ten Network (majority owned by FOX). On average, the member schools are earning $71.875 million each year in the current deal. This doesn't even account for post-season play like the College Football Playoff. The CFP has a separate television contract exclusively with ESPN. There is a <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39766079/college-football-playoff-espn-agree-deal-2031-32//////"target="_blank"> new $7.8 billion dollar contract </a> that is over a 6 year period, where teams who make the playoffs will make money from that TV deal. The many billions spent from the broadcast corporations is essentially lining the pockets of the players. </p>

	<p>While revenue sharing is the big new thing, NIL still is going strong. Schools are still partnering with NIL collective groups to pay players, and negotiate player contracts with other third parties. While there is a salary cap on how much schools can spend, because NIL collectives are not officially a part of any of the universities they have no salary cap. This means that the same schools who have the richest boosters in the Wild West era of NIL still have the inherent advantage. This usually does show up for the on-field results. Many of the <a href="https://https://www.on3.com/nil/news/on3s-top-15-nil-collectives-in-college-sports///////"target="_blank"> biggest NIL collectives </a> are related to some of the most successful College Football programs. However, there is one big change in how NIL deals are regulated. NIL Clearinghouse is the new big regulator of NIL deals. Ran by the company Deloitte, NIL Clearinghouse <a href="https://sportsepreneur.com/nil-clearinghouse-nil-go-guide////////"target="_blank">oversees all NIL deals over $600 on the app/website NIL Go </a>. The way NIL Go works is that all athletes will submit their NIl deals over $600 through the NIL Go portal. Then, the College Sports Commission (CSC) will review each deal. Either, the CSC will approve the deal or reject it. The criteria for each deal is that there can not be any performance based incentives, fake endorsements, above market-value endorsements. or a deal that has no purpose of being made. If the athletes or schools do not comply there are severe penalties. The athletes would lose eligibility, and would have to repay the money they did not report. Schools would lose scholarships, be fined, and potentially have postseason bans. The NCAA and the Federal Government are hoping the new rules deliver more transparency and fade out NIL collectives that operate completely out of the public view.</p>

	<p>The future holds a lot of uncertainty for college sports. The next big step is player unionization. Unlike professional athletes, college athletes do not have a collective bargaining agreement. Teams like Dartmouth men's basketball are starting to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dartmouth-union-ncaa-basketball-players-2fd912fade62ffd81218a6dc91461962////////"target="_blank">push for unionization </a>. But, there is no conference or league wide push yet. This means that there are no standards to contracts or NIL deals that are league wide. Furthermore, the determination of what is market value for one player and what is market value for another is completely arbitrary, and based on a formula that the CSC uses. As the amateur aspect of collegiate sports continues to fade and the professional model takes a stronger shape, the players only have a say through unionizing. A players union with a collective bargaining agreement is the final transition into a system where college athletes are actually compensated for what they are worth.</p>
