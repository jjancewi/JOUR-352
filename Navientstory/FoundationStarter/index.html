<h1> <strong> Data Visiluation: </strong> California or Florida? Who Complains More?</h1>

<h6> <strong> By: Jona Jancewicz | 12/3/2025 </strong> </h6>

<p>One of the largest student loan services in the nation is under-fire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://navient.com///"target="_blank"> Navient </a> is facing countless lawsuits against the company alleging that they were being taken advantage of from the company. The lawsuits began in 2017 and were growing ever since.</p>

<p>In 2022 a settlemnt, acompanied by 39 state attorneys general, required Navient to provide a total of <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates////"target="_blank"> $1.85 billion </a> in relief to private and federal student loan borrowers.</p>

<p>One of the members who sued is The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/////"target="_blank"> CFPB </a> has also been tracking the data of who has filed complaints against Navient. </p>

<p>But the complaints did not stop there. Since 2023 people have filed complaints that Navient is still taking advantage of them. So, I wanted to look at two of the most populus states in the U.S., California and Florida. These states have a lot of people and a lot of collges. Since the settlement in 2022, I want to see which state is complaining more.</p>

<p> The start of the graph is the most complaints in California in the month of January post 2022 at 536. But, afterwards the complaints go down in the following July's and January's, until January 2025. The average amount of complaints in these months is 331. There are still plenty of not happy Californians due to the lawsuit. What's intersting in California is that the complaints are not all spread out eventhly through those months in the years since <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=area&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2025-12-02&date_received_min=2022-12-02&lens=Product&searchField=all&searchText=California&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends////"target="_blank">2022 </a>. It is really only a couple of months that really spike in complaints. The middle three months in the graph are actually decreasing in complaints. This uneven amount of complaints per each month really skews the average amount of complaints higher for California.</p>

<p> The Florida graph is different than the California one. For starters, the complaints are more consistent through multiple months, save for one. The math also shows that over these months the average number of complaints against Navient is 229 per month. This is less than the average complaints from California. However, we need to take into account state populations.</p>

<p> According to USA Facts the last census was in 2022. So the population for Florida and Californian that I am using is based on the census data. Florida is : <a href="https://https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/florida//////"target="_blank"> 22,244,823 </a>. California is: <a href="https://https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/california//////"target="_blank"> 39,029,342</a>.<p>

<p> In California, 1/117,913 (one in one hundred and seventeen thousand and nine hundred and thirteen) person on average filed a complaint. </p>

<p> In Florida, 1/97,138 (one in ninety seven thousand and one hundred thirty eight) person on average filed a complaint. </p>

<p> So, proportinally to each state's population, the average person in Florida is more likely to complaint about Naviant than a person in California.</p>
